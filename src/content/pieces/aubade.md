An *aubade* evokes dawn—as opposed to a nocturne, which evokes night.

*Aubade* was an attempt to write something harmonically interesting but rhythmically simple. The result was a chorale 
for band full of extended harmonies and tritone substitutions.

The music is full of warmth - occassionally pushing towards hot, sticky, uncomfortable.

The work evolved from a *July*, a short prelude for organ that eventually became the first two minutes of music. In late 
2020—during the isolation of Covid-19—I recorded a 5 cello arrangement of the original material, which you can find 
below.
